## Background

With the rapid development of globalization and e-commerce, the complexity of supply chains for goods continues to increase, and consumers are placing higher demands on the quality, safety, and transparency of product origins. Traditional supply chain management methods have numerous issues, such as information asymmetry, data tampering, and counterfeit goods, which not only harm consumer rights but also affect corporate reputation and market competitiveness. Therefore, we aim to establish a transparent and open platform for item information through blockchain technology to address the aforementioned problems.
